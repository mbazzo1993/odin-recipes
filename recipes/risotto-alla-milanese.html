                            The amount of broth required for this recipe is highly variable. 
                            It's best to have plenty of broth in reserve in case more is 
                            needed.

                            Place saffron in a small container and pour in hot water. Let this miixture sit on the countertop for at least 
                            30 minutes.
                        </li>
                        <li>Place broth in a pot on the stove and bring to a simmer.</li>
                        <li>Place hard butter, vegetable oil and onion in a deep heavy pot and place pot on the stove at medium-high heat.</li>
                        <li>
                            Sautee onion until translucent, then add the rice, toasting the grains lightly and stirring them around 
                            constantly with a wooden spoon.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add 1/2 cup of broth to the rice and stir, constantly scraping the bottom of the pot and removing any stuck rice 
                            from the sides. Do this until all the broth in the pan evaporates.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Repeat the previous step until the rice becomes pleasantly tender but not mushy and the rice is suspended in a creamy 
                            matrix of starch and broth.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Remove pot from the burner and mix in the grated parmesan and the soft butter. Continue stirring to incorporate 
                            the butter and parmesan evenly.
                        </li>
                        <li>Serve with additional grated parmesan.</li>
