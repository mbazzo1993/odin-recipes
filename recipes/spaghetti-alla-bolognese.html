        </ul>
        <br />
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Bring a pot of water to boil for the pasta. When it comes to temperature begin the sauce. 
            </li>
            <li>
                In a shallow pan, heat the olive oil and sautee the onion until translucent.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the tuna fish to the pan, breaking it up with a wooden spoon. Ensure the tuna is mixed in 
                well with the sauteed onion. Continue cooking the tuna for several minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the white wine to the sauce and continue cooking until the smell of alcohol has dissipated.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the tomatoes to the pan, along with the puree. Break up the tomatoes with the wooden spoon. 
                Allow the sauce to come to a simmer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Salt the pasta water generously and add the spaghetti to the boiling water. As the sauce continues to simmer, 
                add some pasta water to the sauce if it becomes too dry.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the pasta is 2 minutes away from being "al dente", remove the pasta and add to the sauce pan. Preserve 
                some pasta water and add to the pan. Crank up the sauce and pasta mixture to high heat and stir to coat 
                evenly with the sauce. Continue cooking with the sauce until al dente.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve pasta with chopped parsely sprinkled on top.
            </li>
        </ol>
